#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering refers to the process of creating software that is simple and efficient to use. It is important because it leads to creation of software applications that makes our lives easier which leads to solving of real world problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages like Fotran.
2. Software Engineering was established as a discipline in the 1960s.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements. User needs and requirements are gathered and documented.
2. Design stage. High level designs of the software architecture and user interface are created.
3. Implementation. This is the code writing stage that builds the software according to design specifications.
4. Testing. Various tests are carried out to ensure that the software meets user, functional and design requirements.
5. Deployment.The software is finally released to the end users or customers.
6. Maintenance. Ongoing support, enhancements and updates are made to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology employs a sequential approach to software development while the agile methodology employs an iterative and incremental approach of software development focused on flexibility, collaboration and a response to change. Waterfall methodology is more suitable for softwares that have concrete specifications at the beginning of development and are not likely to change in future while agile is most commonly suitable for projects that require a more flexible approach at each stage of the development cycle.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A software developer is tasked with writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. A project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code while VCSs avail software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among teams.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Constant changing requuirements. Leads to undefined project scopes and project delays.
2. Tight deadlines. The pressure to deliver can lead to reduced software quality.
3. Technical debt. This can interfere with future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies:
Having effective communication during the whole developement cycle, implententing agile methodologies that are more convienient and accomodating to changes and regular reassesment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing is important in software quality assurance because it helps identify and fix defects early in the development process and their correction. leading to high quality software products. The diffrent types of testing include:
1. Unit testing. This involves testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration testing. Tests interactions between different componenets or subsystems.
3. System testing. Tests the system as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing. THis involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user requirements and needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to ability to craft specific questions or statements in order to get the best possible and accurate responses from AI models. It is important because in asking clear and specific prompts, the AI model is able to understand exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: PLease generate an image of a flower.
Improved propmt: Please generate an image of a red rose flower. Also outline the diffrent types and colour of roses and regions in the world where they are most likely to grow.
The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the colour and type of flower, and also additional important information about where they are most likely to grow.
